### The Project

---

Priotask aims at assisting individuals & groups, where necessary, manage their time well and at the same time being able to increase or improve their productivity. Priotask is your FOCUS partner - Follow One Course Until Successful" and is a popular phrase that emphasizes the importance of staying committed to a single goal or objective until it is achieved.
It is based on the pomodoro technique - a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It's a simple yet effective way to improve productivity and focus by breaking work into intervals separated by short breaks.

### The Context

---

This project is our Portfolio Project, concluding our Foundations Year at ALX Africa. We were able to choose who we wanted to work with and what we wanted to work on, as long as we present a working program at the end of the three weeks of development.
